# JavaScript RAG Web App Using Gemini API

This is a full-stack web app with an interactive frontend component that interacts and chats with your custom data using Gemini API. 

Custom data here includes three years of Costco's online and warehouse discount data. Users can interact with the RAG model to ask questions like: 
- when will item X become available for discount this year
- what items are likely to become available for discount next month
- how often does item X become available for discount in a year and when
- etc. 

## Tech Used
- Nodejs
- Express
- Socket.io
- Gemini API (1.5-flash)
- IDX (Google's latest cloud IDE)

Previews should run automatically when starting a workspace. Run the `Show Web Preview` IDX command to see the preview.
